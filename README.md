# AICT---Group-13---Organic-Skincare-Product-Store
Our final project is a **skincare products website** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a focus on frontend design as the backend is not fully implemented.
We chose this project because skincare is a trending topic and allowed us to create an **informative and user-friendly interface** while applying our web development skills.
The website consists of **four pages**: Home, Products, Form, and About Us, each designed to enhance user experience.
The project was developed by **Iman Fatima (251201005 – Group Lead)**, **Fareeha Rehan (251201011)**, and **Eman Ishtiaq (251201003)**.
The complete project has been **uploaded to GitHub**, demonstrating teamwork, creativity, and practical implementation of web technologies.
The home page and About us page is designed by Iman Fatima.
The product page is designed by Eman Ishtiaq.
The Form page is designed by Fareeha Rehan.
